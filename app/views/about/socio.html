    <p>The Invirotel skills development approach is based on internship programs with FET Colleges in South Africa.
        Mentorship and training is offered to
        selected unemployed graduates who join the internship program with Invirotel. Some colleges that are represented
        are South West Gauteng,
        Sekhukhune and Ekurhuleni East.</p>

    <p>The program started in the beginning of 2013 where 12 graduates have been further trained within their relevant
        studies on IT, electrical as well as
        marketing. After completing their internship program nine students have been offered permanent employment with
        Invirotel and others have moved to
        various organisations across the country. Transnet have seen two of the interns joining their team and one
        intern has joined the internal
        Voltex lighting division.</p>
